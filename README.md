# ðŸ§  AI Fullstack Project

This repository contains the **AI Fullstack** project â€” an intelligent job application tracking system that merges traditional full-stack web development with AI capabilities to streamline and enhance the job search experience.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

AI Fullstack is a modern, end-to-end web application that empowers job seekers to efficiently manage, analyze, and optimize their job applications. It leverages artificial intelligence to:

- Score resume-job description compatibility using NLP.
- Recommend improvements to resumes or applications.
- Track application statuses, interviews, and notes via a clean dashboard.

This project showcases how AI can be practically embedded into full-stack architecture, demonstrating intelligent decision-making and user-centric design.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java + Spring Boot (REST API, JWT Authentication)
- **Frontend**: React.js (UI/UX)
- **AI Module**: Python (Flask or FastAPI microservice for NLP & ML tasks)
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Dev Tools**: Postman, VS Code, Git

## ðŸ“Œ Applications

- **Career Platforms**: Can be extended to work as a backend engine for platforms like LinkedIn or Glassdoor.
- **Job Portals**: Useful for integrating resume match scoring in job boards.
- **Recruitment Software**: Can serve as a prototype for intelligent ATS (Applicant Tracking Systems).
- **University Career Centers**: Helps students manage applications and gain resume suggestions.
- **Freelance Platforms**: Enhance matching of freelancer profiles to projects or gigs.
